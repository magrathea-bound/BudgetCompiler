# Overview
A script to compile my bank transactions and apply a category to them for better budgeting.   
This script will be intended for a Power BI report later for better visualizing

# Current Status
I am able to compile the data into one dataframe and merge the merchant key categories to group transactions better.   
Further steps will be to remove raw data that has been used and update merchant key.  
Potential bonus step will be to pull the data automatically.
